# Data_Visualization-Using-Seaborn_library
 
This repository contains code for various Seaborn visualizations, demonstrating proficiency in data visualization with Seaborn.

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. Seaborn is widely used in data science and analytics, especially in fields like finance, social science, and neuroscience.

Scatter Plot:

This script shows how to create a scatter plot using Seaborn. It loads the "tips" dataset from Seaborn and plots the "total_bill" vs "tip" using a scatter plot. It then sets the title and axis labels and displays the plot.

Regression Plot:

This script shows how to create a regression plot using Seaborn. It loads the "tips" dataset from Seaborn and plots the "total_bill" vs "tip" using a regression plot. It then sets the title and axis labels and displays the plot.

Line Plot:

This script shows how to create a line plot using Seaborn. It creates a sample dataset with sales and profit data for 10 years and plots the sales and profit over time using Seaborn's lineplot function. It then sets the title, axis labels, and legend and displays the plot.

Bar Plot:

This script shows how to create a bar plot using Seaborn. It creates a sample dataset with sales and profit data for four regions and plots the sales and profit by region using Seaborn's barplot function. It then sets the title, axis labels, and legend and displays the plot.

Histogram:

This script shows how to create a histogram using Seaborn. It loads the "diamonds" dataset from Seaborn and plots the distribution of diamond prices using a histogram. It then sets the title and axis labels and displays the plot.

Box Plot:

This script shows how to create a box plot using Seaborn. It creates a sample dataset with scores for three groups and plots the scores by group using Seaborn's boxplot function. It then sets the title and axis labels and displays the plot.

Violin Plot:

This script shows how to create a violin plot using Seaborn. It loads the "tips" dataset from Seaborn and plots the distribution of total bills by day of the week using a violin plot. It then sets the title and axis labels and displays the plot.

Heatmap:

This script shows how to create a heatmap using Seaborn. It loads the flights dataset from Seaborn, pivots the data to create a matrix for the heatmap, and creates the heatmap using Seaborn's heatmap function. It then adds labels to the plot and displays it.

Pair Plot:

This script loads the iris dataset using Seaborn and creates a pair plot to visualize the relationships between different features. It sets the title of the plot and displays it using matplotlib's show function. The plot is colored by species and uses a kernel density estimate for the diagonal plots.

Overall, this repository demonstrates proficiency in data visualization with Seaborn and showcases different types of plots that can be created using Seaborn.
